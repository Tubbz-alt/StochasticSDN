# StochasticSDN

A stochastic minizinc solution to solve a software defined network configiguration problem


## Synopsis
In this project we conisider an hipothetical SDN (Software Defined Network). This network is composed by a certain number of domains, and into each domain there is a certain number of VNF (Virtual Network Function). This network represent a graph connected component and our goal is to minimize the links weight between two different domains.  


## Code

**TODO**
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

**TODO**
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

## Installation

**TODO**
Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

**TODO**
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

**TODO**
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
