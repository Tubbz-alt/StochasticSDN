# StochasticSDN

A stochastic minizinc solution to solve a software defined network configiguration problem


## Synopsis
In this project we conisider an hipothetical SDN (Software Defined Network). This network is composed by a certain number of domains, and into each domain there is a certain number of VNF (Virtual Network Function). This network represent a graph connected component and our goal is to minimize the links weight between two different domains.  


## Code

**TODO**
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

**TODO**
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

## Installation

To try this project need to install Minizinc package.
You can run from MiniZinc IDE the Progetto_Intelligenza_Artificiale.mzn file or run from temrinal
```bash
mzn-g12mip <nomefile.dzn>
```
## Tests

**TODO**
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
